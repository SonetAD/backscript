# BackScript

**Type the code once, let BackScript type it again...**

**BackScript is an innovative tool for developers and programming content creators! It retypes your code line-by-line, mimicking the experience of live coding. Perfect for tutorial videos, workshops, or presentations, BackScript ensures you have full control over the retyping speed and sequence.**

## Installation

To install BackScript, use npm:

```bash
npm install -g backscript
```

## Usage

1. **Basic Command**:
   Provide the path to the file you want to retype:

   ```bash
   backscript /path/to/your/codefile.js
   ```

   If the file path is not provided, BackScript will prompt you to input it as an argument.

2. **Set Typing Speed**:
   Customize the typing speed with the `--wpm` option:

   ```bash
   backscript /path/to/your/codefile.js --wpm 50
   ```

   If the WPM option is not provided, BackScript defaults to an impressive 305 WPM — the typing speed of the world’s fastest typer! (Yes, we’re challenging you to keep up.)

3. **Highlight the Next Line**:
   _This feature is under development and will be available in future updates._

4. **Help Command**:
   Display help information:

   ```bash
   backscript --help
   ```
